# *Visualising Earnings Based On College Majors*

***In this mini-project, we will work with data taken from FiveThirtyEight [(Github)](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/recent-grads.csv), on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.<br><br>We will learn to visualise data using Histograms, ScatterPlots, ScatterMatrix Plots and Bar Charts to see if useful insights can be drawn from them.***
